// Package arith implements arithmetic on the elliptic curve bn256.G1.
// The parameters are coherent with the ones used in the Ethereum
// precompiled contracts.
//
// As a matter of fact, most types and functions of arith are simple
// wrappers around the types and functions of
// github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/crypto/bn256
